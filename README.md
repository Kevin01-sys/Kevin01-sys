### Hi there! I'm Kevin.
A software developer who studied at Duoc UC, I love to create programs, web pages, etc.👋

- 🐳 I’m currently working on: 
    - Create a presentation portfolio.
    - CRUD in a REST API with mysql or MongoDB executing HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT) from the Postman application. 
    - Creating a web page with tools such as HTML, CSS, JS, QUERY, PHP.
    - Move all the projects done so far to Docker, because I love using Docker development environments since I discovered the tool.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning English to be able to read and write in a natural way. My native language is Spanish.
- 🐾 I’m looking to collaborate on all types of software development projects
- 💬 Ask me about any of my GitHub projects, it's always great to work with more people.
